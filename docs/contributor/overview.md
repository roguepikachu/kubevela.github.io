The developer guide including two parts:

1. The first part is [extension guide](#extension-guide) that introduces how to extend KubeVela, you are also very welcome to contribute your extension to the community.
2. The second part is [contribution guide](#contribution-guide) that introduces how to participate and contribute to the community.

## Extension Guide

This part is a guide to help you extend capabilities for KubeVela. Make sure you have already understand the [**core concepts**](../getting-started/core-concept.md) before you start.

### Extend Addons

Building or installing addons is the most important way to extend KubeVela, there's a growing [catalog](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog) of addons you can choose for installation. You can also share your platform extension by KubeVela addon registry.

* [Build Your Own Addon](../platform-engineers/addon/intro.md).
* [Build Your Addon Registry](../platform-engineers/addon/addon-registry.md).
* [Extend Cloud Resources by Addon](../platform-engineers/addon/terraform.md).

### Learn CUE to extend more powerful features

KubeVela use CUE as it's core engine, and you can use CUE and CRD controller to glue almost every infrastructure capabilities.
As a result, you can extend more powerful features for your platform.

- Start to [Learn Manage Definition with CUE](../platform-engineers/cue/basic.md).
- Learn what is [CRD Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in Kubernetes.

## Contribution Guide

KubeVela project is initialized and maintained by the cloud native community since day 0 with [bootstrapping contributors from 8+ different organizations](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/OWNERS.md#bootstrap-contributors). We intend for KubeVela to have an open governance since the very beginning and donate the project to neutral foundation as soon as it's released. 

Two things apply to everyone. To help us create a safe and positive community experience for all, we require all participants adhere to the CNCF Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). And every contribution requires you to sign off your commits under the Developer Certificate of Origin, see [Sign Your Commits (DCO)](./code-contribute.md#sign-your-commits-dco) for how to do that.

This part is a guide to help you through the process of contributing to KubeVela.

### First-time contributor checklist

If you're contributing code for the first time, work through these in order:

1. Read the CNCF Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
2. Set up your local development environment by following [Run KubeVela Locally](./code-contribute.md#run-kubevela-locally).
3. Pick up something to work on from the [good first issue](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/labels/good%20first%20issue) list.
4. Sign off your commits with `git commit -s`, see [Sign Your Commits (DCO)](./code-contribute.md#sign-your-commits-dco).
5. Run `make reviewable` before you open the pull request, see [Your first pull request](./code-contribute.md#your-first-pull-request).

### Become a contributor

You can contribute to KubeVela in several ways including code and non-code contributions,
we appreciate every effort you contribute to the community. Here are some examples:

* Contribute to the codebase and docs.
* Report and triage issues.
* Organize meetups and user groups in your local area.
* Help others by answering questions about KubeVela.

### Communication

The community talks on the CNCF Slack channel `#kubevela-dev`, on DingTalk and WeChat groups, and in the weekly community meetings. The joining links, group IDs and meeting schedule all live in one place, see [community communication](https://github.com/kubevela/community#communication).

### Non-code contribution

The Apache way says "Community Over Code". Although KubeVela is a CNCF/Linux project, we possess a strong resonance to it. To second and stretch this merit deeper, we regard non-coding contribution as equally important with code contribution for the community's very existence and its future growth.

- Refer to [Non-code Contribution Guide](./non-code-contribute.md) to know how you could help.

### Code contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to KubeVela codebase? Start by browsing issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

- [Good first issue](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/labels/good%20first%20issue) issues are generally straightforward to complete.
- [Help wanted](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/labels/help%20wanted) issues are problems we would like the community to help us with regardless of complexity.
- Refer to [Code Contribution Guide](./code-contribute.md) for more details.

Learn the [Release Process And Cadence](./release-process.md) to know when your code changes will be released.

### Security

If you find a security vulnerability, report it privately as described in the [security policy](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/blob/master/SECURITY.md) rather than filing a public issue.

### Governance & membership

KubeVela has a role ladder that goes Member, Reviewer, Approver, Maintainer, with each step carrying more review and approval responsibility for the project. Roles are earned through sustained contribution, and the requirements for each one are written down in [community membership](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/community-membership.md).

To see who currently holds which role, check [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/OWNERS.md). For how the project makes decisions, read the [governance](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) document.
